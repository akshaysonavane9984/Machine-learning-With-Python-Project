# Banking Analytics : Holistic Approach to customer value and credit card prediction 


In today's competitive marketplace, understanding customer value and credit card usage is paramount for businesses seeking to optimize their strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. This project aims to adopt a holistic approach by leveraging machine learning models to predict credit scores and assess customer value based on various factors.

Moreover, by predicting credit scores, this project offers financial institutions and credit card issuers valuable insights into the risk profile of individual customers, enabling more accurate underwriting decisions and risk management practices. This proactive approach not only minimizes the likelihood of default but also ensures responsible lending practices and enhances overall portfolio performance.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving the exploration, visualization, and understanding of the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. Through techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps), and correlation analysis, EDA helps identify outliers, missing values, and potential predictors for the machine learning models.

3. Machine Learning Models: Machine learning models are algorithms capable of learning from data and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In this project, various machine learning models are employed to predict credit scores and assess customer value based on the input features. Some commonly used ML models include:

   a. Classification Models: Classification models are used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. Examples include logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). In this project, classification models are utilized to classify customers into high-value and low-value categories based on their creditworthiness and behavior.

   b. Regression Models: Regression models are used to predict continuous numerical values. Examples include linear regression, polynomial regression, and ridge regression. In this project, regression models may be used to predict numerical variables such as credit scores or spending amounts based on various predictor variables.

4. Prediction: Prediction refers to the process of using trained machine learning models to forecast future outcomes or make decisions based on new data inputs. In this project, prediction involves applying the trained models to unseen data to predict credit scores, assess customer value, and make recommendations or decisions regarding credit card offerings, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

This pie chart shows the percentage of credit applications approved by different banks.  The largest slice represents the bank with the highest approval rate, while the smallest slice represents the bank with the lowest.  This information could be useful for understanding lending patterns across various financial institutions.
